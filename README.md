You need to have COLMAP installed, follow the instructions [here](https://colmap.github.io/install.html). If you're running on a Mac you need to have the several dependencies installed. Look at the file `install-dependencies.sh` to see what needs to be installed. Or blindly run it if you want.

The script for downloading data is in the `download-data.sh` script. If you encounter any error unzipping, just unzip manually. I'm sure you can figure that out.
